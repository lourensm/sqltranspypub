# sqltranspypub
public part of sqltranspy. The repository is very much finetuned to one single kith and kin database. That's mainly why the repository is not public. 
The wiki could not be added to the private repository as that would require paying for a license.
The wiki of this repository is also very finetuned to one setup.
